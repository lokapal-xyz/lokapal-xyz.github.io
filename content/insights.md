DAO Insights is the knowledge and research hub of Lokapal, dedicated to advancing understanding in decentralized governance, DAO structures, and philosophical underpinnings of decentralization. It consists of three key areas:

## ðŸ”¹HowToDAO
HowToDAO is an educational resource designed to make DAOs accessible to everyone. It offers:
- A GitHub repository tailored for tech-savvy users and a website for non-technical audiences, both containing the same core information.
- A structured learning path, from beginner-friendly introductions to in-depth concepts for experienced individuals.

## ðŸ”¹DAO Horizons
DAO Horizons is the research publication arm of Lokapal, focusing on system theory and philosophy as they relate to DAOs and decentralized governance. It provides:
- Analytical articles exploring governance mechanisms, systemic structures, and philosophical interpretations of decentralization.
- A Substack page where articles are mirrored for wider accessibility.

## ðŸ”¹Conciliatorics
Conciliatorics is the foundational philosophical work behind Lokapal, the result of over 20 years of analytical exploration and practical experience. It delves into the interplay between interstitial and intrinsic aspects of systems, ultimately arguing that decentralization is the key to systemic balance.
